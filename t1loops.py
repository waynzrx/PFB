## Q1 -----------------------------------
##----------------------------------------
## write a program with for loop
##
## Before the for loop:
##  - assign string "Sat" to variable, name
##  - initialise a variable 
##    (to be used as counter), i, to 1 
##
## write a print statement to output:
## This for loop will loop for 3 times
##
## NOTE: the no. shd be dynamic; i.e. if a string
## of 5 characters is subsequently assigned to name
## it should reflect as 5 accordingly, and so on
##
## write a for loop to output this:
## Loop 1: S from name will be assigned to char; i.e. char = S
## Loop 2: a from name will be assigned to char; i.e. char = a
## Loop 3: t from name will be assigned to char; i.e. char = t
##
## EXAMPLE of output when program is 
## completed and "Sat" is assigned to name:
##  
## This for loop will loop for 3 times
## Loop 1: S from name will be assigned to char; i.e. char = S
## Loop 2: a from name will be assigned to char; i.e. char = a
## Loop 3: t from name will be assigned to char; i.e. char = t

# initialise counter i to 1 before loop



name = "Sato"
    ## Q ❔--------------------------------------------
## 
##-------------------------------------------------
## write a program to include function, fls_demo(), 
## with a parameter, name, to perform the above
## when executed with this 👀 line (outside the function)
## for example:
## fls_demo("Sato")
##
## the output should be:
## This for loop will loop for 4 times
## Loop 1: S from name will be assigned to char; i.e. char = S
## Loop 2: a from name will be assigned to char; i.e. char = a
## Loop 3: t from name will be assigned to char; i.e. char = t
## Loop 4: o from name will be assigned to char; i.e. char = o
##
## Hint: no return statement required


    

## The time value of money (TVM) means that a sum of money is 
## worth more now than the same sum of money in the future.
## Simple TVM formula:
## FV equals PV multiply by (1+int)
 
## FV   => future value of money
## PV   => present value of money
## int    => simple interest rate (decimals)
 
## NOTE: we're using a simple case here without
## i.e. assume annual interest w/o multi-period compounding
 
## Write a program to calculate FV with PV and 
## interest rate (in decimals, e.g. 0.1 for 10%) as inputs from users
##
## e.g. if user enters 1000 and 0.1 respectively, output will be:
## 
## The future value of $1,000.00 is $1,100.00
##
## NOTE: Use f-string for output
